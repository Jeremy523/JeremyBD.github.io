# Hi!
## My name is Jeremy De La Cruz and this is my personal page with a few of my personal projects.

### CURRENTLY:
- As it is in development, the only way to run it is via localhost:8080 after initializing npm
- Created core backend componenets, namely using express.js and node.js so far

### TODO:
- Flesh out pages; the plan as of now is to have 3 separate pages
    - a bio
    - a project page
    - an experience page
- Figure out what the hell the design is gonna look like and how I will organize everything
- Separate projects by date, to better show progression and all that fun stuff
