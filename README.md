# Hi!
## My name is Jeremy De La Cruz and this is my personal page with a few of my personal projects.
### TODO:
- Get the site up and running!
    - Implement node.js, express.js, and nunjucks (essentially most of the MEAN stack)
    - OR create it as a Tornado Web App with Python
    - OR create it as a static web page if Github allows nothing else
- Have the site be a bio for me and include a projects section, etc
- DEFINITELY separate by year, to better show progression
