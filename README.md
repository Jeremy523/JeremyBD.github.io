# Hi!
## My name is Jeremy De La Cruz and this is my personal page with a few of my personal projects.

### TODO:
- Utilize dev branch to minimize risk to master branch
- Get the site up and running!
    - Implement node.js, express.js, and nunjucks (essentially most of the MEAN stack)
    - OR create it as a Tornado Web App with Python
    - OR create it as a static web page if Github allows nothing else
- Have the site be a bio for me and include a projects section, etc
- Separate projects by date, to better show progression
