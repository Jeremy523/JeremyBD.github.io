# Hi!
## My name is Jeremy De La Cruz and this is my personal page with a few of my personal projects.
----------------------------
### TODO:
- Implement node.js, express.js, and nunjucks (essentially most of the MEAN stack)
- Have the site be a bio for me and include a projects section, etc
- DEFINITELY separate by year, to better show progression
