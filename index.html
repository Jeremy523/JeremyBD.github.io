				In an attempt to solve the problem of mass boredom, we created <b>The Legend of the Kingslayer</b>, where you play as the Chosen Warrior, selected by a seemingly random event from the Gods to overthrow the Corrupt King and take his place as the True Monarch. The Chosen Warrior was born as a nobody, a mere farmer's boy destined to live and die a nobody. This causes skeptics and thieves to arise in the realm and challenge the Chosen Warrior. The Chosen Warrior must overcome these obstacles and travel far, facing a myriad of others, in order to reach the Corrupt King's Castle and fulfill his destiny.<br />
